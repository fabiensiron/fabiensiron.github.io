            * Currently involved in the development of Asterios Technologies’
              main product (*Core Team*), consisting of a **compiler** for the PsyC language
              (written in **C++**) and a **real-time operating system** (written in **C**)
              by implementing various functionalities such as the fault and error
              management service.

            * Previously involved in the development of a tool (written in
              **Python**) that performs the **validation of compilations** performed
              by the Asterios compiler (*Checker Team*) by implementing the
              tool’s frontend (parser and graph
              analysis), in a context of avionics certification (**DO-178**)

            * Contributed to a technical audit by analyzing Asterios features
              using **HAZOP risk and failure
              analysis** methodology.

            * (Co-)Supervised 3 trainees over the years on topics such as **Lingua
              Franca** to **PsyC** translation and **random PsyC code generation**,
              which led to the discovery of 9 bugs in the Asterios toolchain.
