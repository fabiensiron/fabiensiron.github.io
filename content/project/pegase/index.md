title: Pegase
summary: "Design and implementation of a digital circuit simulator accelerated by a graphics processing unit (**GPU**). The tool generates scheduled gate-level clusters synchronized with time barriers. It is implemented in **Python**, **C++** with **GPU** kernels using **OpenCL**. This project was my end-of-studies engineering project."
