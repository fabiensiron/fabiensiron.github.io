title: CLOCK
summary: "CLOCK (Copilot of Logical Operational Constraint Kernels) is an implementation of a **CCSL** simulator based on a **SAT** solver with several heuristics. The project is implemented in **OCaml** and is compatible with the **VCD** format and the **GtkWave** tool. It is also possible to generate synchronous observers in Lustre."

CLOCK (Copilot of Logical Operational Constraint Kernels) is an implementation of a **CCSL** simulator based on a **SAT** solver with several heuristics. The project is implemented in **OCaml** and is compatible with the **VCD** format and the **GtkWave** tool. It is also possible to generate synchronous observers in Lustre.
