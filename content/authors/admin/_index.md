I am a Research Engineer at the *Software Safety and Security
Laboratory* of the **CEA List** Institute, where I work on
the formal verification of safety-critical real-time systems
in the context of the **Frama-C** platform.
I hold a PhD in Computer Science, focusing on synchronous languages
and formal verification, conducted in collaboration with **Inria**
(KAIROS team) and **Asterios Technologies**, a **CEA** spinoff now
part of the **SAFRAN** group.
In addition, I am a part-time lecturer at
**EPITA**, teaching in the Embedded and Real-Time Systems
specialization, GISTRE.  My research interests lie at the intersection
of safety and security for real-time software, with a focus on
formal methods and their industrial applications.
