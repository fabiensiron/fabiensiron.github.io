I am a software engineer in research and development,
specialized in safety-critical real-time software. I have just
finalized my PhD thesis - in the fields of real-time language
and formal verification - done
in partnership between **Inria** (*Kairos* team) and
the **Krono-Safe** company (coming from the **CEA**, now part of the
of the **Safran** group). I am also
part-time lecturer at **Epita**, an engineering school
specialized in computer science, in the *embedded and
real-time* speciality. My main area of interest is the *security*
and *safety* of software applied
to real-time systems, using formal methods.
